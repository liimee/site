## want to contact me?

not sure why you'd do that, but just email it here. I hope you're fine with a tiny bit of javascript :)

```js
`${(52710024047785).toString(34)}${(664724130).toString(34)}@${(700779688).toString(34)}.email`
```

need a so-called 'instant messaging'? eh, just revolt me `@liimee`, but if you need discord I guess you can email/revolt me first
